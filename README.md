This purpose of this application is provide an application that will garner results for users
on events that occuring in the St. Louis Area. Users (both Guest and User with Accounts) will
provide preference information that will then be used to query a database of events. This database
of events has been compiled by a web scraping tool and will provide information results that
most closely aligns with their identified preferences. 

## Service-Layer
This repository will be used to create the service-layer components of my application, that will

as the intermediary between front-end and backend application processes, functions and database 
communication.
